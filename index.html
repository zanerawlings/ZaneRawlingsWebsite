            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Im really cool and awesome and I have a lot of experience in everything you could imagine.
                For example I worked at Leidos (buzz word) over the summer and it was super lit and fun. I
                 also work at RecWell as a graphic designer and photographer. Please refer to my resume for how 
                 cool I am and stuff.
